# T-cell Atlas AWS

This project is a web-based application for exploring single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data related to Systemic Sclerosis (SSc). It's a Shiny app written in R, designed to be hosted on AWS.

## üöÄ Live Application

The application is hosted on AWS and can be accessed here: [http://your-hosted-app-url.com](http://3.16.156.124/atlas/ )

*(Note: Please replace the placeholder URL with the actual URL of your hosted application.)*

## üöÄ Features

*   **Data Exploration:** Explore and visualize different transcriptomics datasets from published studies.
*   **Interactive Visualizations:**
    *   **UMAP Plots:** Visualize cell clusters and relationships.
    *   **Feature Plots:** Visualize gene expression and pathway activity on UMAP plots.
    *   **Violin Plots, Dot Plots, and Heatmaps:** Compare gene expression across conditions and cell types.
*   **Differential Expression Analysis:** View and download tables of differentially expressed genes (DEGs).
*   **Pathway Analysis:** Analyze gene sets and pathways using the VAM method.
*   **Spatial Data Exploration:** Visualize gene expression in the context of tissue architecture.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

*   **Backend:** R, Shiny
*   **Bioinformatics:** Seurat, VAM
*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
*   **Deployment:** Docker, AWS, GitHub Actions

## üìä Data

The application uses several publicly available datasets from studies on Systemic Sclerosis and related conditions. The data is in the form of Seurat objects and includes single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data.

The datasets are configured in `app_code/config/datasets.tsv` and include data from the following studies:

*   Tabib et al. 2021
*   Gur et al. 2022
*   Ma et al. 2024
*   Khanna et al. 2022
*   TMKMH integrated dataset

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This application is designed for deployment on AWS. The `Dockerfile` is used to containerize the application, and the `.github/workflows` directory contains GitHub Actions for automated deployment to a development or production environment.
